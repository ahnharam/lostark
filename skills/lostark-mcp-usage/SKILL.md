# Lostark MCP Usage

## Workflow
1. Read `docs/guides/mcp-usage.md`.
2. Provide the exact command to start the MCP server from the repo root.
3. State that `POSTMAN_API_KEY` is read from `.env` and must not be exposed.
4. Provide a header example for Lost Ark API calls.
5. Share the session context snippet when a new chat needs it.

## Output expectations
- Provide commands in fenced `bash` blocks.
- Avoid printing secret values or raw API keys.
- Keep header names and environment variables exact.

- `docs/guides/mcp-usage.md`
