# Lostark Dev Quickstart

## Scope
- Cover local setup and one-click preparation.
- Cover service/port map and health checks.
- Cover run commands for frontend and backend.
- Cover key endpoints and the troubleshooting checklist.
- Cover high-level frontend/backend structure summary.

## Workflow
1. Read `docs/dev-quickstart.md` as the source of truth.
2. Quote exact commands and endpoint paths from the doc.
3. When asked about services, include both URL and port.
4. When asked about frontend structure or routing, use section 6.
5. When asked about backend architecture or scheduler behavior, use sections 7-8.
6. For troubleshooting, follow section 9 and ask for the exact error output.

## Output expectations
- Provide commands in fenced `bash` blocks.
- Keep port numbers explicit and unchanged.
- Ask targeted follow-up questions when a step fails.
