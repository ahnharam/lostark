# Lostark Armory API

## Workflow
1. Read `docs/references/lostark-armory.md` for endpoint shapes and field notes.
2. When a concrete example is needed, open the matching JSON in `docs/references/lostark-armory-responses/`.
3. Call out fields that are known to be strings, nullable, or HTML/JSON tooltips.
4. Keep field names as-is; avoid renaming in documentation.

## Output expectations
- Cite the exact endpoint path.
- Note any quirks (string numbers, tooltip formats, optional arrays).
- Provide a minimal example when a sample JSON exists.

## Resources
- `docs/references/lostark-armory.md`
